## TODO LIST

This is my ongoing to-do list. I'll try to keep track of my ideas and the progress I made in coding my life manager app.

### GIT & GITHUB

With this projet, I want to become more familiar with [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) and [GITHUB](https://github.com/). I used the [_Newb Quest - Intro to Git and Github_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YDGeJti9sg) to learn ore about GIT and GITHUB.

- [x] Configure local git with name and email.
- [x] Initialize a git repo localy.
- [x] Create a list of standard for my commits.
  - [x] How to properly write a commit.
  - [x] List of standard emojis to use. _Because commit without emojis are not fun!_
- [x] Initial Commit.
- [x] Check how to log my commits
- [x] Initialize a git repo on github.
- [x] Push commits to github.
- [ ] Learn to fork a repo.
- [ ] Clone a github repo.
- [ ] Create a branch in a local repo _(git)_.
- [ ] Make a pull request from a forked github repo.
- [ ] Accept a pull request on a github repo.
- [ ] Setup github pages.
- [ ] Setup CLI git aliases.

## PERSONAL WIKI

This is the place where I'll keep all the info I learned during this project. This will be a mix of personal standard that I set for myself and bit&pieces of information that could help me develop my app better.

> ### How to write a good commit message
>
> _Link to the source: [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)_
>
> - Concise and Consistent.
> - A diff will tell you what changed, but only the commit message can properly tell you why.
> - A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence:
>   _If applied, this commit will <ins>your subject line here<ins>_ > <br/><br/>
>
> **The seven rules of a great Git commit message**
>
> 1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
> 2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
> 3. Capitalize the subject line
> 4. Do not end the subject line with a period
> 5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
> 6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
> 7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
>
> _**Example of a good commit**. It can look overkill, but you d'ont havve to use every features_
>
> ```
> Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less
>
> More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
> characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
> subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body. The
> blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless
> you omit the body entirely); various tools like `log`, `shortlog`
> and `rebase` can get confused if you run the two together.
>
> Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
> are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
> Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this
> change? Here's the place to explain them.
>
> Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
>
>  - Bullet points are okay, too
>
>  - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
>    by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
>    vary here
>
> If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
> like this:
>
> Resolves: #123
> See also: #456, #789\
> ```
>
> For the emojis, I'll be using a Visual Studio Code Extensions named Emoji Commits. They have a standard list of Emojis to use with the proper title start.
